The Gold Dinar Movement is decentralized, global movement advocating the the re-introduction of the Islamic Gold Dinar and Silver Dirham as the currency in the Muslim world, in view of their importance and Shariah, and being historically viable basis of Shariah-mandated sound money based currency system.

It has proponents all over the world, and have been working on multiple fronts, including attempts to:

a) Persuade governments to adopt principles of Islamic trade, and change prevailing monetary systems in their respective countries.
b) Educate the masses to adopt Islamic Trade, either symbolically by sale of coins or realistically by trading with coins
c) Depose contemporary Islamic financial jurisprudence, by developing alterantive literature that is more faithful to Islamic principles, by way of publishing books, articles and research papers.
d) Establish Mints and Financial institutions that can model the true endstate of an Islamic economic system. This current Wakala Network project is part of this effort.
