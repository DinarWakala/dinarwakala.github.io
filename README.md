### 1. Preface

Islam prohibits interest and usury (Q:3:129). Islamic Banking's attempt to introduce an interest-avoiding¹ financial system is fundamentally flawed: It [violates Shariah principles](Case-Agaisnt-Banks), and delivers no economic benefit in spirit of the original prohibition.


### 2. About Us

This project is an open source community effort, led by a group of volunteers and activists associated with the Gold Dinar Movement. Names of the prominent project participants will be listed here as the project progresses. Currently, the primary sponsor of the project (the author), is Muhammad Asif Shiraz, the founder of Dinar Wakala LLC., a private company registered in the great state of Texas. The relationship of the for-profit Dinar with this project is explained in the disclaimer section.


### 3. Introduction

The purpose of this project is to develop a framework for an alternative, Islamic financial system, that faithfully follows the spirit and law of the Islamic Shariah and its prohibition of Riba.  This open source framework consists of following artifacts, which will be developed by volunteers and made available to everyone.

1. Establishment of the Master Wakala, non-profit organization which will operate coordinate and oversee the operation of the individual Wakalas, and provide central clearing facilities much like an alternative to some Halal subset of central bank services.

2. Development of the legal framework, model contracts and operational model for independent for-profit Wakalas. These will act as alternative to Banks: Model financial instititions that offer safekeeping of Dinars and Dirhams, and participate in the Wakala Network for their transfer and settlement. Other financial intermediation services can also be offered by these institutions.

3. Development of software artifacts, to operate the individual Wakalas and the Master Wakala, using blockchain and cloud technology.

### 4. Goals of the Wakala Network Project

1. **Governance and Operational Blueprints**: The first goal of the project is Develop intellectual capital for implementation of true Islamic financial institutions: A job that organizations like Islamic Ideology Council, AAOIFI, and State Bank of Pakistan are supposed to do but are failing badly at.

2. **Practicl Demonstration**: To answer all those who think that an Islamic Financial System cannot work except on the lines modern Islamic Banking has taken, this project will demonstrate that in today's fast paced economy, it is still possible to follow the Halal way, and establish institutions that are practical, and profitable, without compromising on Shariah at every step of the way like Islamic Banks.

3. **Relief to Common Man**: Irrespective of tall claims of eventual economic benefits of an Islamic system, the ground reality for the common man is that excessive devaluation is eroding his life savings by the minute. An immediate goal of this project is to finally enable the common man to benefit from the Islamic principles of sound money and participate in an alternative currency regime that acts as a hedge against inflation.

4. **Foundation for bigger changes**: Allow the foundation and this project to become a platform for people to congregate on and exert political influence for lasting changes in the country's legal and financial system. With the "bank account" being a stronger instrument of public franchise than the ballot, if enough likeminded people start subscribing to the financial services offered by this project, it can gradually grow into a behemoth of morally-upright corporate power which establishes itself as the de facto voice to be reckoned with in terms of weight in financial decision making, and steering the country's direction towards a more just and true Islamic economic foundation.


### 5. About the Gold Dinar Movement

The Gold Dinar Movement is decentralized, global movement advocating the the re-introduction of the Islamic Gold Dinar and Silver Dirham as the currency in the Muslim world, in view of their importance and Shariah, and being historically viable basis of Shariah-mandated sound money based currency system.

It has proponents all over the world, and have been working on multiple fronts, including attempts to:

a) Persuade governments to adopt principles of Islamic trade, and change prevailing monetary systems in their respective countries.
b) Educate the masses to adopt Islamic Trade, either symbolically by sale of coins or realistically by trading with coins
c) Depose contemporary Islamic financial jurisprudence, by developing alterantive literature that is more faithful to Islamic principles, by way of publishing books, articles and research papers.
d) Establish Mints and Financial institutions that can model the true endstate of an Islamic economic system. This current Wakala Network project is part of this effort.

### 6. How it works

Since we cannot wait forever for the government to act, our vision is basically to introduce an industry driven collective initiative which can provide all the services that modern day businesses require. We will not delve into the details of each and every service we offer, as financial services sector keeps changing and new products keep getting added. Our basic point is to illustrate that by hiring appropriate industry experts, we will work to provide the full suite of services similar to present day banking, but under an alternative gold-backed arrangement.


## Footnotes

¹ We prefer to use the phrase interest-avoiding instead of interest-free. The later was a poor translation choice in earlier literature, which instills the notion that loans in Islam ought to be interest-free, which is not the case. Islam recognizes the time-value of money, and proposes investment-based profit and loss sharing strategies for the business domain. It is true that interest-free loans, Qard-e-Hasan, are mentioned and extolled in Islamic literature, but that is in context of a private act of charity and piety, and not as a business requirement for a financial intermediary.

² [Dinar Wakala](http://www.dinarwakala.com) is the producer of the very first Islamic Gold Dinar in the American Continent. Other notables coins produced and sold by it include the silver 10 Dirham honoring the famous civil rights leader, Malcolm X.
