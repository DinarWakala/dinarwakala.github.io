### 1. Preface

Islam prohibits interest and usury (Q:3:129), also known as Riba. Islamic Banking's attempt to introduce an interest-avoiding¹ financial system is fundamentally flawed: It directly violates Shariah principles, and delivers no economic benefit in spirit of the original prohibition.


### 2. About Us

This project is an open source community effort, led by a group of volunteers and activists associated with the Gold Dinar Movement. Names of the prominent project participants will be listed here as the project progresses. Currently, the primary sponsor of the project (the author), is Muhammad Asif Shiraz, the founder of Dinar Wakala LLC, a private company registered in the great state of Texas. The relationship of the for-profit Dinar with this project is explained in the disclaimer section.


### 3. Introduction

The purpose of this project is to develop a framework for an alternative, Islamic financial system, that faithfully follows the spirit and law of the Islamic Shariah and its prohibition of Riba.  This open source framework consists of following artifacts, which will be developed by volunteers and made available to everyone.

1. Establishment of the Master Wakala, non-profit organization which will operate coordinate and oversee the operation of the individual Wakalas, and provide central clearing facilities much like an alternative to some Halal subset of central bank services.

2. Development of the legal framework, model contracts and operational model for independent for-profit Wakalas. These will act as alternative to Banks: Model financial instititions that offer safekeeping of Dinars and Dirhams, and participate in the Wakala Network for their transfer and settlement. Other financial intermediation services can also be offered by these institutions.

3. Development of software artifacts, to operate the individual Wakalas and the Master Wakala, using blockchain and cloud technology.


### 4. Goals of the Wakala Network Project

1. **Model Blueprints**: The first goal of the project is Develop intellectual capital for implementation of true Islamic financial institutions: A job that organizations like Islamic Ideology Council, AAOIFI, and State Bank of Pakistan are supposed to do but are failing badly at.

2. Thought Leadersihp: rge on this final one: the ultimate objective we have before us is to strengthen Pakistan and make it a model Islamic state. Out beyond the fog of imminent catastrophes, and the current political and social malaise, lies a long road ahead of human resource, infrastructure and nation building. The responsibility of introducing a gold-backed truly Islamic economic model in our country would ultimately fall upon us, and its long term planning and implementation on the right footings, must have started as of yesterday! Or at least today! eGold will gradually transform itself into a publicly owned entity managed by visionaries who share this common objective, and slowly evolve a financial enterprise that is a role model for other Islamic initiatives that “truly” want to be Shariah compliant.


3. After years of devastation through successive wars in Afghanistan, there came a time when 1 US Dollar exchanged for 21,000 Afghanis. Inflation, and excessive currency issuance causes an immediate, drastic erosion of the common man’s savings and wealth, exacerbated by adverse circumstances like political instability and war. In face of consistent devlatuion of the Rupee, it is vital to provide a mechanism to our lower and middle class people of sustaining whatever little wealth they have. By allow them to leverage precious metals based alterantive currency, we intend to offer people a real hedge against inflation, that can benefit them today, rather than wait for Jam tomorrow through all the talk of Interest-free banking making any actual economic impact.

4. Allow the foundation and this project to become a platform for people to congregate on and exert political influence for lasting changes in the country's legal and financial system. By using the "bank account" as a much more powerful instrument of public franchise, than the ballot, we can grow this alternative system to enough economic significane that it can negotiate Islamic reforms in an effective way. If enough patriotic people start subscribing to the financial services offered by this project, it can gradually grow into a behemoth of morally-upright corporate power which establishes itself as the de facto voice to be reckoned with in terms of weight in financial decision making.


### 5. About the Gold Dinar Movement

The Gold Dinar Movement is decentralized, global movement advocating the the re-introduction of the Islamic Gold Dinar and Silver Dirham as the currency in the Muslim world, in view of their importance and Shariah, and being historically viable basis of Shariah-mandated sound money based currency system.

It has proponents all over the world, and have been working on multiple fronts, including attempts to:

a) Persuade governments to adopt principles of Islamic trade, and change prevailing monetary systems in their respective countries.
b) Educate the masses to adopt Islamic Trade, either symbolically by sale of coins or realistically by trading with coins
c) Depose contemporary Islamic financial jurisprudence, by developing alterantive literature that is more faithful to Islamic principles, by way of publishing books, articles and research papers.
d) Establish Mints and Financial institutions that can model the true endstate of an Islamic economic system. This current Wakala Network project is part of this effort.


## Footnotes

¹ We prefer to use the phrase interest-avoiding instead of interest-free. The later was a poor translation choice in earlier literature, which instills the notion that loans in Islam ought to be interest-free, which is not the case. Islam recognizes the time-value of money, and proposes investment-based profit and loss sharing strategies for the business domain. It is true that interest-free loans, Qard-e-Hasan, are mentioned and extolled in Islamic literature, but that is in context of a private act of charity and piety, and not as a business requirement for a financial intermediary.

² [Dinar Wakala](http://www.dinarwakala.com) is the producer of the very first Islamic Gold Dinar in the American Continent. Other notables coins produced and sold by it include the silver 10 Dirham honoring the famous civil rights leader, Malcolm X.
