### 1. Preface

Islam prohibits interest and usury (Q:3:129). Islamic Banking's attempt to introduce an interest-avoiding¹ financial system is fundamentally flawed: It directly violates Shariah principles, and delivers no economic benefit in spirit of the original prohibition.


### About Us

This project is an open source community effort, led by a group of volunteers and activists associated with the Gold Dinar Movement. The primary sponsor of the project (the author), is Muhammad Asif Shiraz, the founder of Dinar Wakala LLC, a private company registered in the great state of Texas. The association of the for-profit Dinar Wakala with this project is explained in the disclaimer section.


The purpose of this project is to develop a framework for developing an alternative financial system, with gold-based banking-like institutions operating in a cooperating network of transmission, much like the older Hawala system.

The idea behind Dinar Wakala was to promote sound money in the American Muslim community, and introduce them to the concepts of Riba and Islamic economic system. 

This project is the 
introduce a Gold-Backed banking-like institution in the country. The idea behind eGold is to demonstrate to the world how such a system can operate and still be profitable, while complying with the three guiding tenets of fully Shariah-Compliance. These were:
Commodity-backed (gold and silver)
Riba-Free transactions
Gharar-free operation (Full reserve)
Apart from the above “publically stated-objective” of establishing a model Islamic financial institution, there are a number of additional benefits that constitute part of the long term vision of this project. These are follows:

Conformity with Shariah

The guiding principle behind this whole endeavor is to establish an institution that is in complete conformity with the Islamic Shariah, on “both sides of the balance sheet”, and not just its customer facing operations as is the case with present day Islamic Banks. The reason why prevalent Islamic banking is un-Islamic and why gold-backed system is a necessity for true riba-free operations is explained in detail in our document on Riba. http://www.egold.pk/education/riba.aspx

Political and Financial Strength
 It is beyond doubt that true power and strength lies in the control of money, thus, indirectly in the control of human and financial resources. Politics as well as Geo-Politics, is all ultimately a game of who controls how many resources. The western powers encircling us politically is primarily to control our natural resources like oil, and their financial system is geared towards “shortchanging” our currencies and economic output, and keep us in a state of debt and inflation. 

The power of ideology in such circumstances is that it allows a reformer to exert influence on individuals and make them to break free from the shackles of money/resource masters. This is what BrassTacks is doing as a powerful, original, ideological movement empowering the people to exert their own independent opinion and take their destiny in their own hands. eGold, on the other hand, is approaching the problem from the other side: We take the battle of the money-game into the very own turf of the money-masters of the world, and break free from them by developing our very own, independent, world-class alternative economic eco-system – or at least a first step towards it.

The idea behind this approach is very simple: The bank account is a much more powerful instrument of public franchise, than the ballot. Step by step, eGold will focus on capturing customers in regional markets, starting from Rawalpindi, and over the span of a number of years, expand into a large, grass-roots financial services company, where we will decide what welfare projects to finance, and what development sectors to promote. In this way, our soft-revolution can slowly and gradually bring together the patriotic players of this nation into a behemoth of morally-upright corporate power which establishes itself as the de facto voice to be reckoned with in terms of weight in financial decision making.

Preparation for Imminent Threats

After years of devastation through successive wars in Afghanistan, there came a time when 1 US Dollar exchanged for 21,000 Afghanis. Inflation, and an immediate, drastic erosion of the common man’s savings and wealth, is one of the very first outcomes of war and violence. Pakistan today stands at the brink of such a possibility. In the event of economic uncertainty and consequent devaluation of the rupee, it is urgently vital to plan ahead and provide a mechanism to our lower and middle class people of sustaining whatever little wealth they have through the coming hard times by establishing indigenous, privately held gold-reserves, controlled by our own people.

Nation Building

Both of the above points, actually all converge on this final one: the ultimate objective we have before us is to strengthen Pakistan and make it a model Islamic state. Out beyond the fog of imminent catastrophes, and the current political and social malaise, lies a long road ahead of human resource, infrastructure and nation building. The responsibility of introducing a gold-backed truly Islamic economic model in our country would ultimately fall upon us, and its long term planning and implementation on the right footings, must have started as of yesterday! Or at least today! eGold will gradually transform itself into a publicly owned entity managed by visionaries who share this common objective, and slowly evolve a financial enterprise that is a role model for other Islamic initiatives that “truly” want to be Shariah compliant.

## Footnotes

¹ We prefer to use the phrase interest-avoiding instead of interest-free. The later was a poor translation choice in earlier literature, which instills the notion that loans in Islam ought to be interest-free, which is not the case. Islam recognizes the time-value of money, and proposes investment-based profit and loss sharing strategies for the business domain. It is true that interest-free loans, Qard-e-Hasan, are mentioned and extolled in Islamic literature, but that is in context of a private act of charity and piety, and not as a business requirement for a financial intermediary.

² [Dinar Wakala](http://www.dinarwakala.com) is the producer of the very first Islamic Gold Dinar in the American Continent. Other notables coins produced and sold by it include the silver 10 Dirham honoring the famous civil rights leader, Malcolm X.
